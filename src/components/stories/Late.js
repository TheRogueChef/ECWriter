                I am late for the world. I am just now, as a 52-year-old really seeing who we are as a nation. In my length of time on this planet I have seen the advent of mass information on a second-by-second global level. In that enormous mountain of sped up life education came wave after wave of real life for those around us. We had been allowed for generation after generation to be formed and shaped by our families and our immediate community. The woes of those we see illuminated nightly on the magic box were millions of miles away. But now we see. We have direct pipelines in to the daily horrors our fellow Americans have endured for, well, ever. I am embarrassed by this, but not so deeply that it would cause a freeze in my boiling rage at the uncovering. I don’t consider myself some person of great depth or having had some glimpse in to eons of sage advice, I feel I am a pretty typical guy going through a fairly typical life. However, it looks like my seemingly inherent empathy or my naturally felt sense of outrage are not as ubiquitous as I thought.

                I have seen horrors imparted on people who look different from me I cannot even get my brain around them, but, I’m late. I have been shown things that I have only imagined happened in terrible fiction. I’m really late.  The evil I see and the hatred that is out there is almost scripted in its depravity and soullessness. Man, I’m so very late. This has been a reality for so many for so long. It feels like white privilege to even write this with such outrage, and it is. But I am a guy who was born in the late 60’s and grew up in a white world. So, yes white privilege it is; by default, and only allows me my lens, but that’s what white privilege is. Still regardless of why I see it, I do see it. No wait, not a good choice of words. I don’t see it, I feel it. The outrage, embarrassment, guilt is real. I don’t know how a person can impart such violence and viciousness on a person they know nothing about, but I have never had to endure racism and the deeply ingrained lessons taught over and over. Regardless, I am starting to sound all white guy preachy so, enough of that.

                My really significant best friend in my experimental teen years was a black guy, his name was Tim. I never noticed Tim’s color as something other than the difference that his hair was different or he kept his room cleaner than I did most of the time. By contrast my other best friend was painfully white, like almost albino-esque. But I only really see that now, at the time it was just 3 friends who all looked different, but who all acted pretty much the same. We experienced what I think was an A-typical teenage life with lots of wild fun and rule breaking. Never over the top, never too dangerous, but just right. I have no idea how it was through Tim’s eyes. During our entire friendship we only experienced one really bad moment of racism against my friend that he seemed so accustomed too. This brings to light that moments of racism in his life were much more commonplace than I would know. Again, this all feels so weird and entitled to write, please know that its not intentional. I feel a level of guilt to find out I have been on the team of the bad guys for a really long time.

                I’m here now. I try to use my voice to scream out against this unfairness. The horrors that we see now have been shown for one very important reason, its time. This is enough. We have to fight for our soul as a nation of equality and true justice. Its time to break this cycle and as history has shown us, it has to be done by all. Everyone should feel the outrage that any other human can be relegated as worthless or otherwise simply because of a physical difference. The white class has ruled as oppressors for too long. Now as humans we have to pull back all the curtains, uncover every rock and pull out every skeleton to address it. We are on a finite path as a species with all this vitriol ahead of us. Any model of almost any situation will show you that lack of progression equates to a finite existence. The only way as a thriving human species we can survive is to embrace progression and move forward as one collective species, not race.

                I don’t really mean to quote others, but really, Imagine. Imagine what we could do if we didn’t have a second’s regard for another’s physical appearance in terms of hatred or judgement. Imagine what we could do with all the energy and policy if we could see the sum of solutions through one lens, equal and fair for all. Imagine where we would be if we truly only argued over how, we get stronger with both options having so many benefits the discussion is by its own nature civil and, yes, progressive. Yes, I know that the weed is showing a bit here in my unicorn and fairy tale wishes for our world, but really, what if?

                OK, I am at that point where I feel as if I am over writing on this and diluting why I wrote this piece. I am late, but I am here. I am so sorry to anyone who has to experience this type of hatred for any type of intolerance. I am sorry for my lack of knowledge in this area and that I wasn’t made aware sooner. I am very proud that my son sees the world I imagine already. He doesn’t see colors as races, but as simple differences like eye color or shoe brand. He and his generation will be better than us, and hopefully they will truly embrace the idea of ‘enough’. Let these horrors we show them in our world now, be the audacities of a stupid angry past that they would never even imagine letting creep back in their worlds. Again, I wander. So, here Ill end it. We can be better as a species, just gotta not be too late.
