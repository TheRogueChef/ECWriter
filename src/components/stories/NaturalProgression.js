                    I remember being younger and thinking there was some magic switch that gets tripped as we near the late 20’s and ‘POP’ we are grownups. Hehe. I remember people with the touch of grey framing their faces held all the answers, as if some great power of vast knowledge was bestowed upon them on say their 40th birthday and by 50 they must be just about ready to take up residence atop the nearest giant mountain apex only to start espousing wisdom on the wide-eyed and curious. Well, as we all know, that didn’t happen. Dammit. But what did happen is equally amazing and extremely powerful.

                    I have developed some pretty strong opinions and have done years and years of self-analysis to ditch what I hate and nurture what I like about myself. During these years as I muddled along time marched annoyingly on, the decades stacked, and I waited for the ‘POP’. But throughout those years I was doing something I didn’t pay attention to, I was learning. This was only through my own life filter as hazy and threadbare as it had become. Still, with all this aging going on I was gleaning volumes of learned experience and learning the value of understanding others filters as each is so infinitely personal. Now in my 50’s I can appreciate, more than ever, what I have learned. I have learned I am a huge advocate of counseling. We all need help occasionally and should be wide open to those among us who have the wisdom we need and the ability to impart it to us. My journey to counseling (both personally and professionally) has allowed me to wrestle with myself, properly armed with effective tools. It has also shown me the value of another’s educated perspective. That’s the amazing part to me, is that’s all it is, perspective. It’s downright crazy to me how in just a short conversation someone can hear you being open and say one or two sentences that alter the trajectory of your life. I’ve always called these ‘AHA Moments’.

                    Through this time spent I have identified that in my professional journey, what I refer to as the ‘next chapter – What now Cheffey?’ in my Book of Erik, I have become one of those grey framed fonts. I have things in my head I don’t even know are there until you put a knife in my hand or stand me up in a kitchen. I remember one of my instructors from culinary school would often after teaching the class the required kitchen curriculum, pull me aside and say, “Here’s how you will really want to do this in the industry.” He saw the lifer in me, so as he taught me, he knew I would be putting the information to much repeated use. I have anchored my entire culinary approach on that simple lesson, how will it actually be done? And as I said, damn, I’ve learned a lot in my 30 plus years in kitchens.

                    I have been involved in many different formats of kitchen over the years. I’ve worked in tiny owner driven joints up to uber corporate settings. I’ve run multiple units and have managed every type of team associated with the restaurant world. I chased the fame side of the world for a long time doing what I could to get in front of any camera or moving pen. I’ve capitalized on being the loud and aggressive pseudo rock star from my earlier years and parlayed that into a career as a loud and aggressive chef. Which, I thought for years is what the job looked like, even though I have been taught by some of the kindest and most caring mentors. Like I said, always through my own filter. I wore the heavy coat of Gigantic Ego for too long, and unfortunately it robbed me of being able to truly love where this industry can steer folks like me, teaching. At one point about 7 years ago I had my entire self-view (both personally and professionally) rocked when my son, who was 10 at that time, referred to me as ‘Mad Dad’. I am not a violent person, nor am I abusive to anyone. But my son was seeing how my lust for avarice was not only physically keeping me absent in his upbringing but manifesting itself into what my wife called ‘A porcupine made of knives’. I can’t tell you how devastating it is as a father and husband to hear these words. It’s as I said, all perspective. The two people I loved saw a very different person to the one I thought I was being. It was that lightening bolt moment when you hear from the very people you live for that the path you are living on their behalf is sucking a lot for both. Things had to change.

                    I had been a strong believer in the macho bullshit of ‘man up’ almost all my life and carried that stupid idea out during my daily self-loathing rituals. I then moved on to self-shaming myself as it was easier considering I was lost and ill equipped to help myself. It was really a crappy period to be in and through the crap I realized I was clueless. I had no idea who I was anymore or was ever. It was time for me to try something I had knowingly ignored and written off as fluff, counseling. I met a fantastic LMHC (Licensed Mental Health Counselor) almost right away when I opened myself up to the idea of someone helping me get my shit together. Ironically, her main clients were young folks dealing with anxieties and lack-of-self-knowledge issues, just like me. It was rough for, I would say, the first year of counseling as I had to introduce myself to me, and the person I described myself as, out loud, was a dick. So that took time. But after many, many conversations I have crafted the best tools for me to deal with myself and found out the person I REALLY want to be in my personal life. I like me now. I’m a really good dad, I’m a really good husband and I am a really good friend. I love the people I have surrounded myself with and I really like how truly nerdy I am. I love my hobbies (Anything Star Wars/Cosplay/writing/Cooking/Legos etc.) and finally I am comfortable being in my own skin. I still have bumpy times but have great help around me and really great tools to cope. I embraced the help of others and allowed it to open me up to see who I could be, if I wanted to be. Again, I learned.

                    Now, here’s the weird part. I never even dreamt that I could make this same kind of adjustment to my career. I figured the next phase in my culinary career was that of the ‘burn out’. I was just resigned to the idea of being the grumpy and jaded kitchen curmudgeon who just wants to ride out the remaining chef years at some uneventful and mediocre job waiting for the clock to hit go-home-thirty. I had completely ignored my own lessons of belief in others for help. I was made aware of career counselors throughout life and again, chalked them up to feel good cheerleaders who just help write resumes and maybe help you network a bit. Guess what? I was wrong again! I did some homework on what these types of counselors and coaches do for people. I read testimonials one after another praising the work that the clients were going through and the outcomes they were experiencing. It was a great reminder to me of how we have many collective experiences as humans and in some cases being typical is perfect. I read things written by chefs like me and other restaurant folk. So, I signed up for a service, throwing myself into the experience and hoping for the best. When I started, I was interviewed and answered some general questions which paired me up with a coach best suited for folks in my same situation. They set me up with someone who had experience specifically with those of us who wanted change in their career to the tune of no more, something new please. In the first part of the process, we identified what is important to me in my work life and how do I get there. Ironically enough I identified nothing from my culinary training during this process, which turns out was me being a bit fatalistic in my approach to the exhaustion I feel from the industry. I mention this, as now I understand I want to share my culinary experience. When I think about the idea of being some form of culinary educator and being able to be part of someone else’s culinary journey, frankly it makes me a little giddy. My wife and son would attest to my proclivity to no stop chattering. I do talk a lot but when I listen to what is flowing so freely from my oral cavity, I see that it’s knowledge. I have had a weird, exciting, scary, unbelievable and fascinating ride in my life up to now and I have EXPERIENCED a lot of being human during it. I want to share it with others and to be able to give them skills or, at the very least, advice that may stick with them and come in to play one day. I live this every moment with my son in my personal life, acknowledging his own humanness but me being the guide to point out important events and exotic locales. I recognize that each one of us is wildly individual and at the same time we are melting pots of the varied ingredients we have met in our lives. I want to be the basil sprig or lemon zest in someone’s personal life recipe. It made perfect sense after hearing some other perceptions that I should follow that path for the moment and see where it leads. Yet another example of where it all got better because I had another chance to learn.

                    And that, patient reader, is where I am now in my life chapter. I am taking the time I need to align myself up with what I think will fill my soul in my career. I’m looking to teach others and hope that is in my near future. I am the only where I am in this life with the help from my friends, so if you are stuck in any kind of spot in your life where it makes you feel exhausted, please reach out. There are people out there who have been right where you are and they thought just like you do, but they sought out change and they are happy, so it’s real. I’ll keep talking and hoping maybe something I write will hit home and help a little bit. Above all else, love hard, eat well, respect each other and rock on.
