                    I recently lost a good friend, a furry family member. His name was Keegan (AKA: Keegity Keegers, Misser Keegs and The Keegs). He was a sweet little guy, who for the most part, I think, believed he was part cat. He was completely happy just lounging. He did have his doggy moments and did enjoy his daily walks, but for the most part, to curl up in one of the myriads of cat/dog beds around the house and peek out at his world through heavy lidded eyes was his happiness. He was a very handsome cattle dog/mix of a canine, mid-sized and really smart. Mostly though he just loved as his main job in life, loved like tomorrow isn’t coming and now is obviously the most important moment in time.

                    When we met our Misser Keegs he was already two years old. He had had a life before us in California somewhere. There was nothing much else to know about him, a mystery dog. We would notice later on that he had obviously been mistreated by a man and really had a large worry when it came to loud noises. Keegs was brought in to our life as a bargain. Caden had been the cross bar in our ‘H’ pattern in bed for his whole life and he was getting big. So, we said he could get a dog if he slept in his own bed, with the dog. That was how we all met our little friend. We went to the Humane Society in Bellevue and wandered around the kennels, looking. We knew our dog had to be on the smaller side. He or she would have to be fairly even tempered and not a working dog that required lots of work time to lead a happy existence. We need this new addition to be more young than old, and not a puppy. So, the desires were specific. Then there he was. In all ways, at least for us, he was perfect. He did have mountains of energy, displayed by his non-stop waist high bouncing for about an hour. He was joy. He stole the hearts of Caden and Audra right away. I was worried that his energy may be too much given that it was about 38 million times higher than any of ours. But, damn he was cute and so loving, I quickly caved and let myself fall in love with the little fella too. Eventually, the appropriate documents were signed and given to the appropriate staff and away we went, The Carlsons and their first and only family dog Keegan. Technically, he wasn’t Keegan at the time. His name was either Hayden or Aiden, but we already had a Caden, so that wasn’t gonna’ work out for any of us. Seeing how the pooch was supposed to be the four-legged half of a traditional ‘boy and his dog’ relationship, we told Caden he could give him another name if he would like. It just happened that at that point in school Cadens best friend was another boy named Keegan. So, well, you see how the next parts fit and Keegen he became. And, yes, his addition to the family unit kept Caden in his own comfy bed from his first day home and ever since.

                    Interesting note, Keegan was Audras dog. She cared for him. She walked him most of the time. She cared for him at every turn and aided him on every doggy issue that arose. And, he loved her. OH MAH GAWD, did that little dog love Audra. I mean, I can totally see how anybody can love Audra, she is absolutely amazing, but Keegans entire being rose and set on my lovely wife. He followed her everywhere right up in to his ripe old years. He ignored all other distractions, even food, if it meant that his mom wasn’t part of it. That undying and almost manic love can, at times, be a tiny bit tedious even for the purest of hearts like Audras, but keegan was never too much, even in the hardest of situations. He was just so easy to have in our lives and so easy to fall for that his simple act of just being brought joy to everyone he crossed paths with.

                    A couple weeks ago, Keegan passed away. He had been struggling with health issues in the much later years of his life and he finally succumb to its tenacity. It was a very sad time for us, as it is for any who lose a loved one, furry or not. Our pets become so much more to us. The unconditional love of a sweet pooch like Keegan is intoxicating. It’s adorable and it’s something we can only find in the dog/human relationship. Keegans ashes now rest in a sweet little blue urn in our living room bearing a small leather collar and the silver tag, Keegan. I miss him and I will always love that he was the one and only dog in our family. RIP Keegity Keegers, you were very loved and will be remembered forever.
