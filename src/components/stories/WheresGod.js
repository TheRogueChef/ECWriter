                Uh-oh, maybe I shouldn’t write this. I want to write about religion, from a devout Atheist standpoint.

                Dang, right there I alienated at least half of you.

                I’m having a crisis moment with understanding us as Americans, and even more, as humans. I am seeing the most horrific scenes in my adult life all played out on the premise of a god. I can’t wrap my head around it. Playing devils advocate to myself I can hear the throngs of voices saying I don’t understand BECAUSE I am Atheist. That my understanding is limited to the simple reality of daily life instead of greatness in a fantastic realm where all good goes one way and all bad goes the other. But who’s keeping track of the ‘good’ and the ‘bad’? The answer to anyone who has religion in their life is always the same, it’s gods plan.

                Really?

                As a teenager I grew up around the Religious. In fact, it wasn’t until I was much older that I even met a true Atheist. I was brought up non-religious. If you were to ask my mom what she believed her response was Agnostic. In my limited knowledge of the many, many, many religious followers, Agnostic was those who just aren’t sure and would like to hedge their bets on the chances that there is an all-powerful entity that they may have to someday face. But honestly, we were just non-religious. My family has always proposed that in their personal beliefs they were unsure and that whatever path I chose was completely up to me. So, I did some homework.

                One of my two best friends I remember from early on was from a very religious family. (It’s worth noting here to myself that the other best friend that made up our irreverent trio was the only black kid in our community. It’s interesting to me that the two topics that cause me the most consternation as an adult are religion and racism. Hmmm.) I digress. My friend Rusty was required to attend church every Sunday morning and the house was decorated in early 80’s Jesus Chic. As with most teenage friendships we ended up crashing at whoever’s house often, and assuredly it would be on a Saturday Night. So, our choices were either go to church with the family (Which they never pushed at all. It was solely my own choice to go or not.) or to get up and head home at the butt-crack of dawn. Our friend Tim lived closer to Rusty than I did so he wasn’t in attendance. And, thinking back now, I don’t know what his family believed, I never asked. They seemed non-religious just like me. However, in my curiosity I went with his family a few times.

                The church Rusty and his family attended was called Cavalry Chapel. A very unassuming place that reminded me more of a camp church type facility than a neighborhood house of worship. It was sparsely furnished with mainly a ton of chairs and a pulpit. The services were a lot of me looking down and trying like hell to understand the ancient words in their special book and singing, lots and lots of singing. It seemed happy and light. The vibe was upbeat, non-judgmental, and frankly very welcoming. I enjoyed the energy that surrounded these people. Around my fourth or fifth visit the pastor (I think that was what this branch called their leader. I still haven’t quite figured out the correct religious hierarchy vernacular.) took me aside and took time to answer my questions about God. I only remember asking one question, “What does he or she want from me?” Of course, there were many more questions as the chats took a while, but that’s the only one I really remember. I’m sure that just by asking a selfish question like that most religious folk already see an issue as, according to the kind people of the Cavalry Chapel, being selfless and thinking of others was paramount. He also told me this, which burned into my brain as the basis of what I see ‘Faith’ as, that the god he followed only wanted us to try and be good to each other and ourselves. That was it, no punishment, no rules, no lofty choices, just be cool to everyone. That seemed reasonable and honestly sounded like it would be very easy to follow a religious group if that was the only requirement. The guy even offered to give me his old worn and likely handed down to him, personal Bible. I didn’t take it so he gave me a new one.

                Whew, the Bible. I attempted to read it. I skimmed passages until I would get to a place, I thought I could understand what they were saying, then I would just as quickly be turned off as it read differently than what was described to me by the followers and leaders of Cavalry Chapel. What I was reading was a book of stories. Some horrible, some semi-uplifting but mostly about loyalty and revenge and consequences. I was an avid reader at this period of my life, reading the macabre of Poe or King which added another interesting wrinkle to my understanding of religion and this book. It seemed like fiction. Damn, lost another 25% of you, didn’t I? The focus on loyalty and consequence seemed to be wrapped into every story. Like a compendium of written pieces with those two criteria as the theme of the book. Now, I will say out loud I did not read it all, in fact I read very little, but enough to get the gist of the book’s idea. I’m sure great theologians of ours and past times have poured lifetimes into understanding this book and I’m positive that their interpretation is based on much more than my simple understanding. But, as I often state, I’m an average guy. The world should be focused on the average person understanding the rules of the games and in that I find my righteous soapbox to say my piece from.

                I expressed my opinions on what my bible experiences had been so far, and the pastor heard and offered an interesting solution. Go see this movie about the Apocalypse. Wow, that was a really bad idea! I went and saw through my 15-year-old eyes one of the most terrifying films of all time. In it if you were not devout, rule following, repentant and servile you were going to experience the worst of all imagined terrors any human could face. And, according to the movie, this was gonna happen pretty soon! I left that movie shaken to the core. I wrestled with how a group of people that I felt were the good guys, the caring Christians would ever allow any of those atrocities to happen to anyone. Their teachings had wrongfully led me to believe there was a kind forgiving and above all empathetic entity sitting up on high just making sure that terrible things didn’t happen. But the god I saw in that movie and in years of later investigation was the opposite. That god pitted his own followers against each other in his name. That god promoted the annihilation of entire sects of people based on their apparent belief in the ‘wrong’ God. That god promised ever lasting greatness in a magical kingdom if you did what he said, but by the same token promised the same to your neighbor who believes in their god. I walked away from the idea that religion would ever be part of my life then.

                Since then, I have asked many questions and spoken with many folks who would consider themselves extremely religious. I have also had my own beliefs as a true Atheist reaffirmed almost daily. Through the journey in my later years, I learned a difference between ‘faith’ and ‘religion’. And, honestly, I think Faith is awesome. I think that those people I met back et The Cavalry Chapel were originally the faithful and not the religious. But by its own nature it needed to become a religious entity to support worshippers through the creation of a church. (That gets into taxes and stuff. Another issue I have, but for another time) they carried the torch for religion. I have seen faith carry people through very difficult times. My family even offered it to my grandmother to ease her pain with the loss of my uncle. She didn’t utilize it; however, I still feel some folks could use something like faith when life gets heavy. But religion is a tool created by man to control others, full stop.

                Here comes the anger. Where’s God now? I watch our country impose overwhelming constraints on others based on their religious beliefs. I watch a small righteous bunch attempt at every turn to claim America as theirs. If they really look at what America is they might read that America has the freedom of religion. Yeah, that’s right, our founding fathers understood faith and that each person should be allowed in this great country to believe what they will free from persecution or ridicule. Yet here we are in America 2023 and that group is hijacking the country in the name of God. Telling all others in this free country that if they don’t believe in their religion there will be consequences. The modern religion seemed designed to absolve the user one way or another. In some faiths you can go out and do a bunch of horrible things, but then on an assigned day and in the special cubicle you can be forgiven for all those ills. I’ve even had someone I consider a close friend tell me, “If there was no God I would rape and murder.”

                In his case I’m sure that he doesn’t fully mean that, but it drives home to this point to me. If you believe in this religious icon and follow his rules you can do or not do certain things, completely devoid of the fact that not doing those things is about humanity, not religion. This is where I think so many get lost.

                As far as what religion does to the parts of our world where it has been baked in the collective mindset, I’m speechless. People doing unspeakable things to each other for a God that they all believe in. Their version tells them that their cause is the divine path, and all others are heretic and deserve nothing. More than that it spurs on genocide and worldwide vitriol and hatred that pervades every waking breath. But religion marches on. Each believer confident their version of God is the right one. Their beliefs can’t be questioned or challenged as their divine leader gave them permission to act that way, or at least offers the promise of forgiveness after the heinous act is completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                No one is right. I’m not right and neither are you. I don’t believe in anything regarding religion or faith although, most of my friends have ‘Faith’ in something along those lines. But, that personal relationship with whatever they believe in is secondary to them all being wonderful humans. Their empathy and outrage don’t stem from a perceived religious wrong but instead from a place of being human. Pain and loss are real and how one deals with that is deeply personal. I would never deign to tell another their faith was wrong or even misplaced if it offers them comfort or peace. But I would tell anyone whose life is overruled by pages from a long-adapted book or whose actions are directed by some cosmic being you are wrong. The world is a human place first. That can be seen in the fact that I am an Atheist, and you are not, we are humans first. And that’s where it’s at for me right now and right here in time. Religion needs to be replaced with personal faith and we all need to live first as humans on the same blue ball.

                Ultimately, there is a bible passage that I do really like, and I think it’s the most human piece of that book I ever saw. Please forgive me if I quote it wrong, but here’s what I heard,
                </p>
                <p>
                I am my brother’s keeper.
                </p>
                <p>
                Now, that’s human sentiment we should all share.
