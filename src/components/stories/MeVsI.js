                I’m inconsistent when I talk with myself. I’m duplicitous in my thought process to the point where I can actually surprise myself. I don’t have a split personality per se, but I definitely think with two minds. These weren’t here back in the old days. Back when I was younger and moving through life at dizzying speeds, I only had one mission, one mind…be everything that people want you to be, but be the loudest and right up front. I didn’t give a moments pause to the right or wrong agenda, but solely concentrated on entertaining and establishing. It was easier. Not the clean up of aftermath, which I most certainly spent lots of time on, nor the ramifications of my actions ever swayed my direction. Now, as an older, more reflective man, I am split. I have evolved in to someone who has conversations (unfortunately, out loud sometimes) with myself over most things. I have named the meaner, spiteful one ‘The Critic’ and the other one I simply call ‘Me’. When I’m in a good place ‘The Critic’ is quiet. His ideas are stupid and his depth is so shallow it boggles me that he is also me too. I don’t like the critic. On certain very rare occasions his diatribe of angry uncompassionate ramblings may hit upon a valid concept, while through ‘Me’ eyes the world offers a more optimistic view. At other times he is so loud I need to scream at the top of my lungs in my mind to drown him out. He makes me inconsistent.

                    When I found ‘Me’, I didn’t recognize him. I hadn’t seen him since I was very young. Before my own personal bullshit got in the way. It appears The Critic was driving for most the years I was alive and ‘Me’ was just there to observe, judging at times, but mostly sitting there quietly watching The Critic do his thing, never thinking he was a bad guy. I was re-introduced to ‘Me’ in my mid 40’s. I was asked to describe who I was, what I wanted, what I liked and in the most bizarre moment of self-realization I found I had no answer to any of those questions. I lived as the best husband I thought my wife would want, the most awesome dad my son could want, the most accomplished chef that my superiors and crews could want and the number one friend anyone could want (which I have wrestled with, but that is for another time). I would try and imagine through the minds eye of all those around me thinking, “What would make Erik the best at…?”. It was easier. Then, I was asked who I was to me. Crickets.

                    Im sure if you have read anything Ive written you see I ramble. I tend to veer off topic super easy and have really odd tangents. But I guess that’s what I mean with my inconsistencies. Some of the stuff I write I am fully in my head for when I’m writing, that is ‘Me’. Other times I go back and re-read stuff and think, WTF? The bane of a restless mind. I like to be in the now with ‘Me’ driving. When I’m here I’m loving, caring, severely empathetic and very peaceful. I entertain the idea of old souls and new souls when I think about ‘Me’. If you prescribe to the notion at all of a soul (I borrow this word from my religious friends, because as a devout Atheist the only good descriptor I’m left with is energy, so hippy) you begin to see where the word wise comes from. Ive known people, age irrelevant, that are so wise and seem to have this depth of comprehension I cannot even fathom. As to where ‘Me’ on the other hand is a young soul. I revel in child like experiences. To see my office, one might think they entered a kid’s playroom and not a middle aged mans work space. I love Star Wars and Legos and Pirates and Coloring. It brings ‘Me’ great joy to see fantastic adventure stories or lose myself in the wonder of staged displays and to visit pimped out theme parks. I guess some would say stunted adolescence is the real answer, but, as I have learned, that wouldn’t matter. I find mountains of happiness in these things and I have found that the search for what makes us happy is the real key to life. What was I talking about again?

                    When I realized that I was at this place in life, talking to myself and thinking separately I was worried. I was now not only aware of these inconsistencies, but, as it is all me, I was responsible. I looked back over the years of my life and now some real ugliness, which I had caused, began to recolor the scenes. I reflected on my ‘cut and run’ approach to everything almost always initiated after doing loads and loads of stupid self-centered decisions. As I’ve learned we are incapable of some deep thought in our younger years. That it is, in fact, a large part of our human development to act in these self-preserving ways while living and discovering that independence doesn’t have to equal narcissism. Still, its terribly sobering to rub the sleep of ignorance from your eyes and see what your real legacy has turned out to be.

                During this time of self-awakening I began to compartmentalize The Critic and ‘Me’ in to what has served me versus what will serve me. Meaning what do I not want to be anymore and what would I want to become. Easy to type those simple questions out here, but I am years in to this search and I feel like I’m just scratching the surface. I still see through both sets of my eyes. Like I said in the beginning I have days where one voice is louder than the other and days when I am definitely a better man. But I am inconsistent. Are we all? Do we all teeter back and forth between who we are and who we wanted to be? I strive every day to be a better man for me. When I can make The Critic a quiet silly back seat driver and ‘Me’ is singing along to Cheap Trick in the front seat life is good. I will keep this open question in my life and I truly urge every one of you to ask the same question, “who do I want to be today?” Trust me, one day I won’t be so inconsistent.
